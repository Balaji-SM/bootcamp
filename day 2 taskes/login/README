I am creating a login page with JavaScript validation using HTML tags such as <p>, <label>, <button>, and <input>, along with Bootstrap CSS.

Login Page with JavaScript Validation:

   A login form that includes input fields for username and password.
   Uses <label> for field names, <input> for data entry, and <button> for submission.
   JavaScript is used for form validation (checking if fields are empty, password length, etc.).
   Styled with Bootstrap CSS for a clean and responsive design.
